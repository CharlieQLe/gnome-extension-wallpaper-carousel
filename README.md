# WALLPAPER CAROUSEL

## What is this?

An extension that provides a wallpaper changer that cycles between local wallpaper files based on a timer.

## What versions of GNOME does WALLPAPER CAROUSEL support?

At the time of writing, WALLPAPER CAROUSEL only supports GNOME 43 due to the usage of quick settings.

## How do I install?

Tar packages, nor a published extension are not available yet.

The source can be used by cloning this repository and running the install script like so:

```
git clone https://github.com/CharlieQLe/gnome-extension-wallpaper-carousel.git
sh install.sh
```

After the installation, simply log out and log back in and it should show up in the Extensions application!

## TODO

* If possible, change the appearance of the preferences to use draggable rows or use the same widgets as the Appearance menu in Settings
* Support transition wallpapers
* Publish on [extensions.gnome.org]()
