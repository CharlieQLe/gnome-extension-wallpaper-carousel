# WALLPAPER CAROUSEL

## ___THIS IS UNFINISHED!___

## What is this?

An extension that intends to provide a wallpaper changer that cycles between local wallpaper files based on a timer.

## What versions of GNOME does WALLPAPER CAROUSEL support?

It should likely support GNOME 42, and would absolutely work with GNOME 43.

## TODO

* Get the extension into a working state
    * Parse wallpapers that are not using the XML format
    * Create preferences
        * Display all wallpapers
            * If possible, use the same widgets as the Appearance menu in Settings
        * Adjust the timer based on seconds
* Provide an option to skip to the next wallpaper
* Publish on [extensions.gnome.org]()
